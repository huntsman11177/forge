# üöÄ FORGE: The Complete Bootstrap Roadmap to Market Domination

**Mission:** Build the world's first true WYSIWYG for Flutter frontend with bidirectional code sync and a living application marketplace ‚Äî bootstrapped from $0 to market leader.

---

## üìä Overview: The Journey from $0 to Market Leader

```
Phase 0: Foundation & Validation (Months 0-3)
Phase 1: MVP - Prove the Core Concept (Months 4-9)
Phase 2: Early Adopters & Revenue (Months 10-15)
Phase 3: Marketplace Launch (Months 16-21)
Phase 4: Growth & Scale (Months 22-30)
Phase 5: Market Leadership (Months 31-42)
Phase 6: Ecosystem Dominance (Months 43-60)

Total Timeline: 5 years to overtake Figma/FlutterFlow/Locofy.ai
Bootstrap Approach: Revenue-funded growth (no VC)
```

---

# PHASE 0: FOUNDATION & VALIDATION
**Duration:** Months 0-3  
**Team Size:** 2-3 people (founders)  
**Budget:** $0-$15K (personal savings, side hustle)  
**Goal:** Validate the concept, build proof-of-concept, gather first feedback

---

## Month 0: Market Research & Technical Validation

### Week 1-2: Deep Market Analysis

**What You're Doing:**
- Interview 50 Flutter developers about their pain points
- Join 10 Flutter/React communities (Discord, Reddit, Twitter)
- Analyze FlutterFlow's pricing, features, and user complaints
- Study Figma's collaboration model and limitations
- Research Locofy.ai's conversion quality issues

**Deliverables:**
- Pain points document (what developers hate most)
- Competitive matrix (Forge vs competitors on 20 dimensions)
- Pricing research (what people are willing to pay)
- Feature priority list (what to build first)

**Why This Matters:**
Before writing code, you need to know EXACTLY what problem you're solving and for whom. This research prevents building something nobody wants.

**Success Metrics:**
- 50 developer interviews completed
- 10+ quotes saying "I would pay for this"
- Clear understanding of top 3 pain points

### Week 3-4: Technical Proof of Concept

**What You're Building:**
A throwaway prototype that proves the hardest parts are possible.

**Focus Areas:**

**1. Can You Parse Flutter Code?**
- Use Dart analyzer package to parse a simple Flutter widget
- Extract widget tree structure
- Convert to JSON representation
- Verify you can understand the code structure

**2. Can You Generate Clean Flutter Code?**
- Build a simple widget tree in JSON
- Write templates to generate Dart code
- Test that generated code compiles
- Compare quality with hand-written code

**3. Can You Render Widgets Visually?**
- Create a basic HTML canvas
- Render 5 Flutter widgets (Container, Text, Button, Column, Row)
- Allow drag-and-drop positioning
- Update properties and see visual changes

**Deliverables:**
- Parsing script that reads simple Flutter screens
- Code generator that outputs compilable Dart
- Basic canvas that renders 5 widgets
- Demo video (3 minutes) showing the flow

**Why This Matters:**
These are the three hardest technical challenges. If you can't do these, the product isn't viable. Better to fail in week 3 than month 18.

**Success Metrics:**
- Parse 5 different Flutter screens successfully
- Generate code that compiles without errors
- Canvas renders widgets correctly
- Demo impresses 10 developers

---

## Month 1: Proof of Concept Refinement

### Week 5-6: Expand Widget Support

**What You're Building:**
Expand from 5 widgets to 20 core Flutter widgets.

**Widget Priority List:**

**Tier 1 (Critical - Week 5):**
- ‚úÖ Scaffold (app structure)
- ‚úÖ AppBar (navigation bar)
- ‚úÖ Container (layout box)
- ‚úÖ Text (display text)
- ‚è≥ ElevatedButton (primary button) ‚Äî parsing present; add action coverage + regression test
- ‚úÖ Column (vertical layout)
- ‚úÖ Row (horizontal layout)
- ‚úÖ SizedBox (spacing)

**Tier 2 (Important - Week 6):**
- ‚úÖ ListView (scrollable list)
- ‚úÖ Card (material card)
- ‚è≥ Icon (material icons) ‚Äî capture icon data/font props
- ‚è≥ TextField (text input) ‚Äî parse controllers, validation props
- ‚è≥ Image (display images) ‚Äî support asset/network sources
- ‚úÖ Stack (layered layout)
- ‚úÖ Positioned (absolute positioning)
- ‚úÖ Padding (spacing wrapper)
- ‚è≥ Center (center alignment) ‚Äî add regression coverage
- ‚è≥ Expanded (flex layout) ‚Äî ensure flex factors rendered
- ‚è≥ Flexible (flex layout) ‚Äî support fit/loose props
- ‚è≥ Divider (separator line) ‚Äî capture height/thickness

_Legend:_ ‚úÖ parsing + tests, ‚è≥ parsing planned/to verify

**Widget Support Known Gaps:**
- Add regression coverage for ElevatedButton interactions (onPressed/onLongPress) and simple Center/Expanded/Flexible/Divider cases.
- Extend Icon/TextField/Image parsing for specialized props (icon fonts, keyboard types, image sources).
- Document remaining mismatches between ForgeGraph props and generated Dart code for these widgets.

**Audit Snapshot ‚Äì Engine & Studio Milestones (October¬†30¬†2025)**

- **Tier¬†1 ‚Äì Core Architecture:** _Not yet implemented_  
  No canvas/renderer engine, no formal Forge Schema Language beyond `graph_schema.json`, no persistence layer or plugin system, and no runtime renderer scaffolding exist in the current codebase. Work to date has focused on Rust parsing utilities and Dart code generation helpers.

- **Tier¬†2 ‚Äì Design‚ÄìDev Bridge:** _Not yet implemented_  
  Bidirectional Design/Dev sync, renderer compiler, component grouping, live preview, hot reload, and metadata linking are absent. The project has not yet introduced a UI studio or bridge; focus remains on parser tests and CLI utilities.

**For Each Widget:**
- Define JSON schema (properties, children)
- Create visual representation on canvas
- Build property editor UI
- Write code generation template
- Test import/export round-trip

**Deliverables:**
- 20 widgets fully supported
- Property editors for each widget
- Visual rendering accurate
- Code generation produces clean Dart

**Why This Matters:**
20 widgets covers 80% of typical Flutter UIs. This is enough to build real apps and validate the concept with actual developers.

**Success Metrics:**
- Can build a simple todo app using only these 20 widgets
- Generated code passes Flutter analyzer
- Developers say "this looks like code I would write"

### Cross-Cutting Initiatives Snapshot

| Track | Initiative | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source of Truth | ForgeGraph is canonical; Dart is generated artifact. Treat manual Dart edits as foreign diffs requiring reparse + merge. | Document merge workflow and ship `forge sync --check`. |
| Parsing Architecture | Decide parser strategy (Rust custom parser vs Dart analyzer) and record rationale. | Draft "Parser Strategy" ADR in `/docs/architecture`. |
| Dependency Resolution | Map widget ‚Üî file relationships across imports. | Spec `forge analyze-deps` command + graph output. |
| Incremental Engine | Design graph diffing + preview cache under `.forge/preview_cache/`. | Prototype node hashing + diff store. |
| Studio UX | Add Navigation Graph view, error states (‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå), and `ForgeHistory` undo/redo log. | Define UI flows + history event schema. |
| State Management | Create `ProviderAdapter` interface and provider lifecycle hooks for hot reload-safe edits. | Draft adapter trait + lifecycle doc. |
| CLI & Plugins | Add `forge sync --check`, `forge migrate`, `forge pkg diff`; define `ForgePlugin` contract. | Outline CLI specs + plugin API. |
| AI & Telemetry | Log anonymized graph diffs, plan schema migrations, build embedding pipeline for semantic search. | Create data retention + migration roadmap. |
| Marketplace & Business | Resolve dependency conflicts, sandbox third-party packages, define monetization triggers, enterprise offering. | Add "Marketplace & Monetization" milestone to Phase 3. |

### Week 7-8: Basic State Management

**What You're Building:**
Add Riverpod provider support and visual data binding.

**Features:**

**1. Provider Creation:**
- UI to create StateProvider<T>
- Specify type (String, int, double, bool, custom)
- Set initial value
- Generate provider code

**2. Provider Binding:**
- Select a Text widget
- Choose "Bind to Provider"
- Select balanceProvider
- Generate ref.watch(balanceProvider) code

**3. State Visualization:**
- Show all providers in a panel
- Display current values
- Allow manual state changes for testing
- See UI update live

**Deliverables:**
- Provider creation UI
- Data binding interface
- State testing panel
- Live preview that reacts to state changes

**Why This Matters:**
State management is what separates Forge from Figma. This is your first unique differentiator. Without it, you're just a pretty mockup tool.

**Success Metrics:**
- Create a provider visually
- Bind it to a widget
- Change state ‚Üí See UI update
- Generated code uses proper Riverpod patterns

---

## Month 2: Alpha Version

### Week 9-10: Import Existing Code

**What You're Building:**
The ability to import a simple Flutter app and edit it visually.

**Import Pipeline:**

**Step 1: File Selection**
- User provides path to Flutter project
- Scan lib/ directory for .dart files
- Identify widgets (extends StatelessWidget/StatefulWidget)
- List all screens found

**Step 2: AST Parsing**
- Parse each widget file to AST
- Extract build() method
- Parse return statement recursively
- Build widget tree representation

**Step 3: Pattern Recognition**
- Detect Riverpod providers (final xxxProvider = ...)
- Detect provider watches (ref.watch)
- Detect navigation (context.go, Navigator.push)
- Detect conditional rendering (ternary, if statements)

**Step 4: Graph Construction**
- Convert AST to Forge graph format
- Map widgets to visual representations
- Create provider nodes
- Link bindings

**Step 5: Canvas Rendering**
- Load graph into canvas
- Render visual layout
- Show property panels
- Enable editing

**Deliverables:**
- Import wizard UI
- AST parser for Flutter code
- Pattern recognition library
- Graph builder
- Successfully import 3 sample apps

**Why This Matters:**
This is your KILLER FEATURE. No competitor can import existing code. This means developers can adopt Forge incrementally, not all-or-nothing. This is your unfair advantage.

**Success Metrics:**
- Import a 500-line Flutter app
- 70%+ of UI successfully parsed
- Can edit visually and export back
- Code quality maintained (diff is minimal)

### Week 11-12: Alpha Testing with 10 Developers

**What You're Doing:**
Get the alpha into the hands of real developers and collect brutal feedback.

**Recruitment:**
- Post in r/FlutterDev: "Looking for 10 alpha testers"
- Share in Flutter Discord servers
- Tweet with demo video
- DM developers you interviewed in Month 0

**Testing Process:**

**Each Tester Gets:**
- Access to alpha web app (deployed on Vercel free tier)
- 3 sample Flutter projects to import
- Task list: Import, edit, export, evaluate
- Feedback form with 20 specific questions
- 30-minute video call to watch them use it

**Questions to Ask:**
- Could you import your project? (yes/no, what failed?)
- Was the canvas intuitive? (1-10 rating)
- Was the generated code acceptable? (show diff, get opinion)
- Would you use this in production? (yes/no, why?)
- What's missing that would make you pay for this?
- What would you pay monthly for this tool?

**Deliverables:**
- 10 developers onboarded
- 10 feedback sessions completed
- Detailed notes on pain points
- Feature request list (prioritized)
- Willingness-to-pay data

**Why This Matters:**
You're about to invest months building this. You MUST validate that real developers want it. If 8/10 say "I wouldn't use this," you need to pivot now, not after building the full product.

**Success Metrics:**
- 7/10 developers say "I would use this"
- 5/10 developers say "I would pay for this"
- Average "would pay" price: $20+/month
- Clear consensus on top 3 missing features

---

## Month 3: Decision Point & Planning

### Week 13-14: Analyze Feedback & Decide

**What You're Doing:**
Synthesize all feedback and make the go/no-go decision.

**Analysis Framework:**

**1. Technical Feasibility:**
- Did parsing work well enough? (>70% success rate)
- Was code generation quality acceptable?
- Were there insurmountable technical blockers?

**2. Product-Market Fit:**
- Do developers love the core concept?
- Is the pain point real and urgent?
- Would they switch from current tools?

**3. Monetization Potential:**
- Are people willing to pay?
- Is pricing sustainable ($20-$50/month)?
- Can you reach $10K MRR in 12 months?

**4. Competitive Positioning:**
- Is bidirectional sync a real differentiator?
- Can you compete with FlutterFlow's feature set?
- Do you have defensible moats?

**Decision Matrix:**

**IF:**
- ‚úÖ >70% parsing success rate
- ‚úÖ 7/10 testers would use it
- ‚úÖ 5/10 would pay $20+/month
- ‚úÖ No competitor can do import/export

**THEN:** Full speed ahead to Phase 1 (MVP)

**IF:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è <70% parsing success
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed feedback (some love it, some don't)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Price sensitivity ($5-10/month only)

**THEN:** Iterate for 1 more month, retest

**IF:**
- ‚ùå Can't parse reliably
- ‚ùå Developers don't see value
- ‚ùå Nobody would pay

**THEN:** Pivot or abandon

**Deliverables:**
- Go/No-go decision document
- Validated feature priority list
- Target customer persona refined
- Pricing strategy draft

- Create email list (ConvertKit free tier)
- Write launch blog post (draft)

**Deliverables:**
- Production infrastructure ready
- Development workflow established
- Company legally registered
- Payment processing configured
- Marketing channels set up

**Why This Matters:**
Phase 1 is when you go from "scrappy prototype" to "real product." You need proper infrastructure to move fast without breaking things constantly.

**Budget Checkpoint:**
- Total spent so far: $500-$1,500 (domain, company registration, basic tools)
- Runway: 6+ months (assuming full-time or side hustle income)

---

## END OF PHASE 0 SUMMARY

**What You've Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ Validated market demand (50 developer interviews)
- ‚úÖ Proved technical feasibility (can parse, generate, render)
- ‚úÖ Built proof-of-concept (20 widgets, basic import/export)
- ‚úÖ Tested with real users (10 alpha testers)
- ‚úÖ Made go/no-go decision (data-driven)
- ‚úÖ Set up infrastructure for scale

**Metrics Achieved:**
- 10 alpha testers
- 70%+ parsing success rate
- 7/10 would use it
- 5/10 would pay $20+/month
- Infrastructure ready for MVP

**Next Phase Preview:**
Phase 1 is where you build the real product. You'll expand to 50 widgets, add Dev Mode with logic graphs, polish the UX, and launch to 100 early adopters who will PAY for it.

---

# PHASE 1: MVP - PROVE THE CORE CONCEPT
**Duration:** Months 4-9 (6 months)  
**Team Size:** 2-4 people (founders + maybe 1 contractor)  
**Budget:** $15K-$40K (revenue from early customers + savings)  
**Goal:** Build production-ready MVP, get 100 paying customers, reach $3K MRR

---

## Month 4: Design Mode Foundation

### Week 17-18: Canvas Engine Upgrade

**What You're Building:**
A production-quality canvas that feels smooth and professional.

**Features to Implement:**

**Visual Fidelity:**
- Accurate Flutter widget rendering (pixel-perfect)
- Proper spacing, padding, margins
- Shadow and elevation rendering
- Border radius and decorations
- Font rendering with system fonts

**Interaction Design:**
- Smooth drag-and-drop (60 FPS)
- Multi-select with shift+click
- Resize handles with constraints
- Alignment guides (snap to grid)
- Zoom in/out (25% to 400%)
- Pan with spacebar+drag

**Performance:**
- Canvas renders at 60 FPS even with 100+ widgets
- Lazy loading for large screens
- Virtual scrolling for widget lists
- Optimized re-renders (only changed widgets)

**Undo/Redo:**

- Show undo stack visually
- Persist history across sessions

**Deliverables:**
- Smooth 60 FPS canvas
- All 20 widgets render accurately
- Interactions feel polished
- Undo/redo works perfectly

**Why This Matters:**
Developers are used to polished tools (VS Code, Figma). If Forge feels janky or slow, they won't trust it with their code. First impressions matter enormously.

### Week 19-20: Expand to 50 Core Widgets

**What You're Adding:**

**Material Widgets:**
- FloatingActionButton
- BottomNavigationBar
- TabBar + TabBarView
- Drawer
- Dialog
- SnackBar
- Chip
- Badge
- BottomSheet
- PopupMenuButton

**Form Widgets:**

- Code generation template
- Import parsing support
- Documentation and examples

**Deliverables:**
- 50 widgets fully supported (up from 20)
- Property editors for all
- Import/export works for all
- Widget library categorized and searchable

**Why This Matters:**
50 widgets covers 95% of typical Flutter apps. With this coverage, developers can build real, complex applications entirely in Forge. This is your "feature parity" milestone.

---

## Month 5: Dev Mode & Logic System

### Week 21-22: Dev Mode UI

**What You're Building:**
The structural view that developers need to understand complex apps.

**Widget Hierarchy Outline:**
- Tree view of entire widget structure
- Expand/collapse nodes
- Search widgets by name or type
- Filter by widget type
- Drag to reorder in tree
- Click to highlight in canvas
- Context menu (wrap, extract, delete, duplicate)

**Property Panel Integration:**
- Split view: tree on left, properties on right
- Click widget in tree ‚Üí Show properties
- Edit properties ‚Üí Update canvas immediately
- Show inherited properties (from theme, parent)

**Navigation View:**
- Visual route graph
- All screens and their paths
- Click to jump to screen
- Add new routes visually
- Configure deep links

**Provider Panel:**
- List all providers in project
- Show type and initial value
- See which widgets use each provider
- Create new providers
- Test state changes
- Debug provider lifecycle

**Deliverables:**
- Dev Mode fully functional
- Switch between Design/Dev modes seamlessly
- All features sync between modes
- Performance stays smooth

**Why This Matters:**
Design Mode is for designers and visual thinkers. Dev Mode is for developers who think in structure and logic. You need both to appeal to your full target market.

### Week 23-24: Logic Graph Editor (Phase 1)

**What You're Building:**
Visual node-based programming for UI logic.

**Node Types to Implement:**

**Control Flow:**
- If/Else (conditional branches)
- Switch (multi-way branches)
- For Loop (iterate over lists)

**Actions:**
- Navigate to Screen
- Show Dialog
- Show SnackBar
- Update Provider Value
- Call External Function (black box)

**Data:**
- Get Widget Value (read from TextField)
- Get Provider Value
- Transform Data (map, filter)
- Validate Data (email, phone, etc.)

**Features:**

**Node Editor:**
- Drag nodes from palette
- Connect nodes with edges
- Delete nodes and edges
- Node properties panel
- Collapse/expand node groups

**Execution:**
- Run logic in preview
- Highlight active nodes during execution
- Show variable values at each node
- Pause/step through execution
- Error handling with try/catch nodes

**Code Generation:**
- Convert node graph to Dart methods
- Generate clean, readable code
- Add comments explaining logic
- Handle edge cases properly

**Deliverables:**
- Logic graph editor functional
- 10 core node types implemented
- Can express common patterns (form validation, API calls, navigation)
- Generated code compiles and runs correctly

**Why This Matters:**
This is where Forge transcends from "UI builder" to "application builder." Logic graphs let non-experts build real functionality visually, while giving experts a faster way to scaffold logic.

---

## Month 6: Code Quality & Round-Trip

### Week 25-26: Code Generation Excellence

**What You're Improving:**
Making generated code indistinguishable from hand-written code.

**Code Quality Goals:**

**Readability:**
- Proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Line breaks at logical points
- Whitespace between sections
- Consistent naming conventions
- No unnecessary nesting

**Idiomaticity:**
- Use const constructors where possible
- Extract reusable widgets automatically
- Follow Flutter style guide
- Use recommended patterns (ListView.builder, etc.)
- Avoid anti-patterns

**Comments:**
- Add doc comments to classes
- Explain complex logic
- Note provider dependencies
- Mark auto-generated sections

**Organization:**
- Separate file per screen
- Group widgets in /widgets folder
- Providers in /providers folder
- Routes in /routing folder
- Follow feature-based structure

**Testing:**
- Generate widget tests
- Test provider logic
- Test navigation flows
- Integration test scaffolding

**Optimizations:**
- Tree-shake unused imports
- Remove redundant wrappers
- Optimize widget rebuilds (const, keys)
- Lazy load when appropriate

**Deliverables:**
- Code generator produces "human-quality" code
- Pass Flutter analyzer with zero warnings
- Developers approve code quality (survey)
- Side-by-side comparison passes blind test

**Why This Matters:**
If generated code looks like machine-generated garbage, developers will never trust Forge. But if it looks like code they would write themselves, they'll be willing to commit it to production.

### Week 27-28: Import Improvements

**What You're Improving:**
Parsing success rate from 70% to 85%+.

**Pattern Library Expansion:**

**State Management Patterns:**
- Riverpod (StateProvider, FutureProvider, StreamProvider, NotifierProvider)
- Provider package (Provider, ChangeNotifierProvider)
- Bloc pattern (basic event/state recognition)
- GetX (basic reactive patterns)

**Builder Patterns:**
- ListView.builder ‚Üí Recognize and extract item template
- GridView.builder ‚Üí Same
- FutureBuilder ‚Üí Recognize async patterns
- StreamBuilder ‚Üí Recognize stream patterns
- LayoutBuilder ‚Üí Preserve responsive logic

**Conditional Rendering:**
- Ternary operators (condition ? widget1 : widget2)
- If statements in build methods
- Switch statements
- Null-aware operators (widget ?? fallback)

**Navigation Patterns:**
- go_router routes
- Navigator.push/pop
- Named routes
- Deep links
- Route guards

**Black-Box Handling:**
- Identify unparseable code
- Preserve as-is
- Mark clearly in UI
- Allow repositioning but not editing
- Generate warnings but don't fail

**Runtime Introspection:**
- Inject inspector into test app
- Capture actual widget tree
- Compare with static parse
- Use runtime data to fill gaps
- Validate parsing accuracy

**Deliverables:**
- Parsing success rate: 85%+
- Support 4 state management libraries
- Recognize 20+ common patterns
- Black-box handling graceful
- Runtime introspection working

**Why This Matters:**
85% parsing means Forge works with most production apps. Developers can import their existing codebases and start using Forge immediately, not after rewriting their app.

---

## Month 7: Preview & Testing

### Week 29-30: Live Preview Polish

**What You're Building:**
A preview experience that feels like running the actual app.

**Preview Features:**

**Real Flutter Web Runtime:**
- Embed Flutter Web app in iframe
- Hot reload on any change (<1 second)
- Full interactivity (tap, scroll, input)
- Real state management (providers work)
- Real navigation (routes work)

**Device Emulation:**
- iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone SE
- iPad, iPad Mini
- Pixel 7, Galaxy S23
- Desktop (various sizes)
- Custom dimensions
- Rotate device (portrait/landscape)

**State Testing:**
- Manually set provider values
- Trigger state changes
- Reset to initial state
- Save state snapshots
- Load previous states

**Debugging Tools:**
- Console logs visible
- Error messages highlighted
- Network requests logged (if any)
- Performance metrics (FPS, memory)
- Widget rebuild tracking

**Hot Reload:**
- Change any property ‚Üí See instantly
- Add/remove widgets ‚Üí See instantly
- Edit logic ‚Üí Re-run automatically
- No full page reload needed

**Deliverables:**
- Preview feels like running real app
- Hot reload < 1 second
- All devices render correctly
- Debugging tools useful
- State testing works

**Why This Matters:**
Preview is where developers will spend most of their time testing. If it's slow, buggy, or inaccurate, they won't trust Forge. It needs to feel exactly like running flutter run.

### Week 31-32: Testing & Bug Fixes

**What You're Doing:**
Systematically test everything and fix all critical bugs.

**Testing Protocol:**

**Unit Tests:**
- Widget rendering (all 50 widgets)
- Property editing (all properties)
- Code generation (all patterns)
- Code parsing (all patterns)
- State management (all provider types)

**Integration Tests:**
- Import ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Re-import (identical)
- Design Mode ‚Üî Dev Mode (state preserved)
- Logic graph execution (all node types)
- Preview updates (all interactions)
- Undo/redo (complex scenarios)

**End-to-End Tests:**
- Complete workflow: Import app ‚Üí Edit screens ‚Üí Add logic ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Deploy
- Test with 5 sample apps (varying complexity)
- Measure parsing success rate
- Measure code quality (analyzer score)
- Measure performance (FPS, load times)

**User Testing:**
- 10 developers try the MVP
- Watch them use it (screen recording)
- Identify UX friction points
- Collect bug reports
- Prioritize fixes

**Bug Fixing:**
- Critical bugs (P0): Breaks core functionality ‚Üí Fix immediately
- Major bugs (P1): Causes frustration ‚Üí Fix this week
- Minor bugs (P2): Annoying but workaroundable ‚Üí Fix later
- Nice-to-have (P3): Backlog

**Deliverables:**
- All P0 bugs fixed (zero critical bugs)
- 90% of P1 bugs fixed
- Test coverage > 70%
- Performance meets targets (60 FPS, <3s load)
- Ready for paying customers

**Why This Matters:**
You're about to charge money for this. It MUST work reliably. Buggy products kill trust and generate refunds/chargebacks. Polish now, scale later.

---

## Month 10: Feedback-Driven Iteration

### Week 41-42: User Research & Analytics

**What You're Doing:**
Deep dive into how users actually use Forge and where they struggle.

**Quantitative Analysis:**

**Setup Analytics Infrastructure:**
- Implement Mixpanel or Amplitude
- Track key events (signup, import, edit, export, upgrade)
- Set up funnels (signup ‚Üí activation ‚Üí paid)
- Create user cohorts (by plan, usage, feature adoption)
- Track feature usage (which widgets, which modes, etc.)

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**

**Activation Metrics:**
- % who complete tutorial
- % who successfully import first project
- % who make first edit
- % who export code
- Time to first value (signup ‚Üí export)

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly active users
- Session length
- Actions per session
- Return rate (% who come back day 2, day 7, day 30)
- Feature adoption (Design Mode vs Dev Mode usage)

**Conversion Metrics:**
- Free trial start rate
- Free ‚Üí Pro conversion rate
- Time to conversion
- Failed payment rate
- Churn rate by cohort

**Identify Patterns:**
- Where do users drop off? (funnel analysis)
- Which features correlate with retention?
- Which users convert to paid? (common attributes)
- What predicts churn? (early warning signs)

**Qualitative Research:**

**In-Depth Interviews:**
- Schedule 20 user interviews (30 minutes each)
- Mix of: power users, casual users, churned users, trial users
- Questions to ask:
  - What problem were you trying to solve?
  - What's your typical workflow in Forge?
  - What frustrates you most?
  - What delights you most?
  - What's missing that would make you use Forge more?
  - Would you recommend Forge? Why/why not?

**User Session Recordings:**
- Use Hotjar or FullStory
- Watch 50 user sessions
- Identify confusion points
- Note where users get stuck
- See which features they discover vs miss

**Support Ticket Analysis:**
- Categorize all support requests
- Identify top 10 issues
- Common feature requests
- Bug reports (prioritize by frequency)

**Deliverables:**
- Analytics dashboard with key metrics
- Funnel analysis showing drop-off points
- 20 user interview notes synthesized
- Top 10 issues documented
- Prioritized roadmap based on data

**Why This Matters:**
You've now had 100 users for a month. They've told you (through behavior and feedback) what works and what doesn't. This data guides your next 6 months. Build what users need, not what you think is cool.

### Week 43-44: Critical UX Improvements

**What You're Fixing:**
Address the top 5 most painful UX issues identified in research.

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

**Issue 1: Import Confusion**
Problem: Users don't understand what "parseable" means, get frustrated when import fails.

Solution:
- Add pre-import scan showing what will/won't parse
- Visual report: "15/20 screens parseable, 5 too complex"
- Option to import anyway (black-box unparseable parts)
- Clear explanation of why something can't parse
- Link to documentation on supported patterns

**Issue 2: Property Editor Overwhelm**
Problem: Too many properties, users can't find what they need.

Solution:
- Group properties by category (Layout, Style, Content)
- Collapsible sections (start with common properties visible)
- Search within properties
- "Recently used" section at top
- Contextual help (tooltip explaining each property)

**Issue 3: Mode Switching Disorientation**
Problem: Switching between Design/Dev mode loses context.

Solution:
- Remember scroll position and selection
- Animate transition (smooth, not jarring)
- Visual cue showing which widget is selected in both modes
- Breadcrumb navigation (Screen > Container > Column > Widget)
- "Jump to in [other mode]" button

**Issue 4: Export Expectations Mismatch**
Problem: Users expect export to be "done", don't understand they need to integrate.

Solution:
- Export wizard with clear steps
- Show file structure preview before export
- Instructions on integrating into existing project
- Option to export as complete project (vs just screens)
- Video tutorial linked in export dialog

**Issue 5: Provider Binding Not Obvious**
Problem: Users don't discover how to bind data to widgets.

Solution:
- Visual indicator when widget can be bound (blue outline)
- "Bind Data" button prominent in properties panel
- Drag-and-drop from provider panel to widget
- Tooltip: "Drag provider to widget to bind"
- Tutorial specifically on data binding

**Testing:**
- Deploy fixes to staging
- Test with 5 users (screen share)
- Measure if issues are resolved
- A/B test major changes
- Deploy to production after validation

**Deliverables:**
- Top 5 UX issues fixed
- Measured improvement (analytics show better metrics)
- User feedback confirms issues resolved
- New tutorial videos for confusing features

**Why This Matters:**
Every friction point costs you customers. Removing friction increases activation, engagement, and conversion. The smoothest product wins, not necessarily the most feature-rich.

---

## Month 11: Feature Expansion

### Week 45-46: Advanced Widget Features

**What You're Adding:**
Features that make Forge more powerful for complex apps.

**Responsive Design Tools:**

**Breakpoint System:**
- Define breakpoints (mobile: 0-600, tablet: 601-1024, desktop: 1025+)
- Visual breakpoint toggles in canvas
- Different layouts per breakpoint
- Preview all breakpoints simultaneously
- Generate responsive code (MediaQuery, LayoutBuilder)

**Constraint System:**
- Set min/max width/height
- Aspect ratio constraints
- Flexible vs fixed sizing
- Visual constraint indicators
- Flutter-accurate constraint resolution

**Component System:**

**Custom Components:**

- Transforms (rotate, scale, skew)
- Opacity and visibility
- Keys (for performance)

**Deliverables:**
- Responsive design system working
- Component system fully functional
- Theme system complete
- Advanced properties on all widgets

**Why This Matters:**
These features separate "toy builder" from "professional tool." Real apps need responsive design, reusable components, and consistent theming. Without these, Forge is limited to simple apps.

### Week 47-48: Logic Graph Expansion

**What You're Adding:**
More powerful logic capabilities for complex workflows.

**New Node Types:**

**API Integration Nodes:**
- HTTP Request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Configure URL, headers, body
- Handle response (success/error)
- Parse JSON
- Store in provider

**Async Flow Nodes:**
- Async/Await wrapper
- Future.then chains
- Error handling (try/catch)
- Loading states (isLoading flag)
- Timeout handling

**List Operations:**
- Map (transform each item)
- Filter (keep items matching condition)
- Reduce (aggregate to single value)
- Sort (by field)
- Find (first matching item)

**Form Validation Nodes:**
- Required field check
- Email validation
- Phone validation
- Min/max length
- Custom regex
- Password strength

**Local Storage Nodes:**
- Save to SharedPreferences
- Load from SharedPreferences
- Clear data
- Key-value operations

**Advanced Control Flow:**
- While loop (with max iterations safety)
- Do-while loop
- Break/continue
- Parallel execution (Future.wait)

**Node Graph Improvements:**

**Organization:**
- Node groups (collapsible sections)
- Comments on nodes
- Color coding by type
- Minimap (for large graphs)
- Search nodes

**Debugging:**
- Breakpoints on nodes
- Step-through execution
- Variable inspection
- Execution history
- Performance profiling (which nodes are slow)

**Code Generation:**
- Generate clean async/await code
- Proper error handling
- Extract to named methods (if graph is complex)
- Add comments explaining logic

**Deliverables:**
- 20+ new node types
- Logic graphs handle complex workflows
- Debugging tools functional
- Generated code is clean async/await

**Why This Matters:**
Logic graphs are your differentiator. FlutterFlow has limited logic capabilities. If Forge can express complex logic visually, it becomes viable for real-world apps, not just simple CRUD.

## Month 16: Marketplace Foundation

### Week 61-62: Package Format & Registry

**What You're Building:**
The technical foundation for the package ecosystem.

**ForgePkg Specification:**

**Package Structure:**
- manifest.yaml (metadata, dependencies, permissions)
- ui_graph.json (widget trees)
- logic_graph.json (flows and actions)
- provider_schema.json (state management)
- navigation.json (routes and deep links)
- theme.json (design tokens)
- assets/ folder (images, icons)
- docs/ folder (README, integration guide)
- tests/ folder (validation tests)

**Manifest Schema:**
- Package name and version
- Author information
- License type
- Description and keywords
- Dependencies (other packages)
- Permissions required
- Supported backends
- Flutter/React version requirements
- Screenshots and preview video

**Package Registry:**

**Database Schema:**
- packages table (id, name, author, version, description)
- package_versions table (version history)
- package_dependencies table (dependency graph)
- package_downloads table (analytics)
- package_ratings table (user reviews)
- package_tags table (categorization)

**Storage System:**
- S3 or equivalent for package files
- CDN for fast global distribution
- Versioning (keep all versions)
- Checksums for integrity

**Registry API:**

**Endpoints:**
- POST /packages (publish new package)
- GET /packages (search/browse)
- GET /packages/:id (get package details)
- GET /packages/:id/versions (version history)
- POST /packages/:id/download (download package)
- POST /packages/:id/rate (submit rating)

**CLI Tool:**

**forge-cli commands:**
- `forge init` (create new package)
- `forge pack` (bundle package)
- `forge publish` (upload to registry)
- `forge install <package>` (add to project)
- `forge search <query>` (find packages)
- `forge update` (update dependencies)

**Deliverables:**
- ForgePkg spec documented
- Package registry backend complete
- Storage system configured
- Registry API functional
- CLI tool working
- Test packages published

**Why This Matters:**
The package format is your marketplace's DNA. It must be well-designed from day one because changing it later breaks everything. This specification determines what's possible in the marketplace ecosystem.

### Week 63-64: Validation Pipeline (Phase 1)

**What You're Building:**
Automated quality control for marketplace packages.

**Validation Steps:**

**Step 1: Structure Validation:**
- manifest.yaml exists and is valid
- Required files present
- JSON schemas valid
- Asset files exist
- No malicious file names

**Step 2: Dependency Resolution:**
- All dependencies exist in registry
- Version requirements are satisfiable
- No circular dependencies
- No conflicting versions

**Step 3: Compilation Test:**
- Generate Flutter code from package
- Create temporary Flutter project
- Run `flutter pub get`
- Run `flutter analyze` (must pass with 0 errors)
- Run `flutter build web --release` (must compile)
- Measure build time and size

**Step 4: Security Scan:**
- Check for prohibited APIs (file I/O, eval, etc.)
- Verify all network calls are declared in permissions
- Scan for known vulnerability patterns
- Check dependencies for known vulns

**Validation Infrastructure:**

**Build Farm:**
- Docker containers for isolation
- Linux build agents (cost-effective)
- Queue system for builds
- Timeout handling (5 min max per package)
- Resource limits (4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores)

**Monitoring:**
- Track validation success rate
- Build time metrics
- Failure reasons categorized
- Alert on validation system issues

**Creator Experience:**

**Publish Flow:**
```
Developer runs: forge publish

1. Pack package locally
2. Upload to registry (with progress bar)
3. Start validation (show status updates)
4. Real-time log streaming
5. Success ‚Üí Package live
   Failure ‚Üí Detailed error report
```

**Error Reporting:**
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Code snippets showing problems
- Suggestions for fixes
- Link to documentation
- Option to test locally before publishing

**Deliverables:**
- Validation pipeline functional
- Compilation tests working
- Security scans operational
- Build farm handling 100+ packages/day
- Creator-friendly error messages

**Why This Matters:**
"Must compile = can upload" is your quality guarantee. This pipeline ensures every package in the marketplace actually works. It's your competitive moat against other marketplaces with low-quality content.

## Month 17: Creator Tools & Experience

### Week 65-66: Package Creation Workflow

**What You're Building:**
Tools that make creating packages easy and rewarding.

**In-App Package Creator:**

**Package Wizard:**
- Step 1: Package type (template, component library, feature module)
- Step 2: Basic info (name, description, license)
- Step 3: Select screens/widgets to include
- Step 4: Configure dependencies
- Step 5: Set permissions
- Step 6: Add documentation
- Step 7: Preview & publish

**Package Editor:**

### Week 67-68: Creator Dashboard & Analytics

**What You're Building:**
Tools for creators to understand their package performance and earn money.

**Creator Dashboard:**

**Overview Page:**
- Total downloads (all-time, this month)

- Payment methods (bank account, PayPal)
- Tax information (W-9/W-8 forms)
- Invoice generation

**Payout Schedule:**
- Monthly payouts (NET 30)
- Minimum balance: $50
- Stripe Connect integration
- Automatic tax calculations
- 1099 generation (US creators)

**Revenue Split:**
- Standard: 85% creator, 15% Forge
- Volume bonuses:

Hi [Name],

I've been following your Flutter work (saw your [project/video/package]) 
and it's impressive.

We just launched Forge Marketplace - a platform where Flutter developers 
sell production-ready UI packages. Think "npm for Flutter apps."

Top creators are already earning $500-2000/month. Our marketplace has:
- 500+ paying users actively looking for packages
- 85% revenue share (you keep $85 of every $100)
- Built-in validation (we ensure quality)
- Marketing support (we promote your packages)

Would you be interested in publishing your [component/template] as a package? 
I'd love to feature you as a launch creator.

[Your name]
Founder, Forge
```

**Campaign 2: Design Agencies**

**Target Audience:**
- UI/UX agencies with Flutter experience
- Freelance Flutter designers
- Design system creators

# Forge AI Integration Roadmap
> Extension to Forge Master Plan ‚Äî Phases 4 ‚Üí 6  
> Author: Subrata Saha | Revision: v1.0 | Status: Internal Strategic Document

---

## üéØ Objective

Integrate a **deterministic, schema-aware AI layer** into Forge once production stability (v1.0) is achieved. The AI must:

- Operate **on** the ForgeGraph rather than raw code.  
- Produce **validated** outputs that always compile.  
- Preserve **local-first** execution with optional cloud inference.  
- Increase productivity while maintaining predictability.

## üß≠ Alignment with Existing Phases

| Phase | Core Milestone | AI Layer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 ‚Äì 3** | Engine + Studio + CLI stability | None (baseline) |
| **4** | Optimization + Refinement | AI Inspector + Telemetry Foundation |
| **5** | Intelligent Design Assistance | Text‚ÜíGraph Generator + Layout Optimizer |
| **6** | Intelligent Development Assistance | Logic Composer + Theming Assistant + Refactorer |
| **7+** | Predictive Forge | Full conversational co-developer |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 4 ‚Äî AI Foundation (Post-Production Stability)

### Goal

Lay the infrastructure for deterministic, privacy-respecting inference.

### Deliverables

1. **AI Core Module**

   ```text
   forge_ai/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engine/   # Inference orchestrator (local / cloud)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/  # Prompt + output contracts
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/  # Task-specific agents (Inspector, Text‚ÜíGraph, etc.)
   ```

2. **Telemetry & Data Schema**
   - Collect anonymized graph diffs, edit actions, validation outcomes.  
   - Store under `.forge/ai_logs/` with opt-in sync; never upload by default.

3. **AI Inspector (Static Suggestion Engine)**
   - Rule-based + lightweight ML hybrid.  
   - Detects layout misuse, redundant providers, excessive nesting.  
   - Emits structured recommendations:

     ```json
     {
       "rule": "excessive_nesting",
       "widget": "Column",
       "depth": 7,
       "suggest": "ExtractComponent"
     }
     ```

4. **AI Settings Panel**
   - Toggle inference mode: `Local | Cloud | Off`.  
   - Display active model version, last update timestamp, and telemetry opt-in state.

---

## üß† Phase 5 ‚Äî Intelligent Design Assistance

### Goal

Enable natural-language creation, adaptive layouts, and visual refactoring.

### Components

#### 5.1 Text ‚Üí Graph Generator

- **Input:** Prompt + selected context providers.  
- **Output:** `graph.json` fragment validated against `forge_graph_schema.json`.  
- **Model:** Fine-tuned 3B parameter transformer (T5/LLaMA family, quantized for local-first deployment).

**Flow**

```text
Prompt ‚Üí Model ‚Üí GraphFragment ‚Üí SchemaValidate ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Apply
```

#### 5.2 Smart Layout Optimizer

- Uses a graph-embedding model to suggest optimal parent layouts (Row / Column / Stack / GridView).  
- Normalizes padding, alignment, and spacing across screens.  
- Trained on open-source Flutter repos plus opt-in ForgeGraph telemetry.

#### 5.3 AI Refactorer

- Detects repeated subtrees and proposes reusable components.  
- Suggests prop extraction and state lifting opportunities.  
- Always emits patch diffs:

  ```json
  {
    "action": "extract_component",
    "from": "widget_45",
    "new_component": "BalanceCard"
  }
  ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 6 ‚Äî Intelligent Development Assistance

### Goal

Augment Dev Mode with text-to-logic generation, theming intelligence, and contextual tutoring.

### Components

#### 6.1 Logic Composer (Visual Flow Generator)

- Natural language ‚Üí logic graph nodes (e.g., ‚ÄúWhen button tapped, validate amount > 0 then update balance‚Äù).  
- Generates validated `logic_flow` entries with guardrails for async flows and error handling.  
- Integrates with provider panel to surface available state.

#### 6.2 AI Theming Assistant

- Extracts brand style from palette/logo or uploaded design references.  
- Auto-updates style tokens in ForgeGraph with variant comparisons.  
- Generates 2‚Äì3 A/B theme variants for review before application.

#### 6.3 AI Tutor / Reviewer

- Continuous background lint with educational tooltips (e.g., ‚ÄúProvider not used ‚Üí consider removal‚Äù).  
- Flags rebuild-cost hotspots and recommends `const` usage or memoization.  
- Links every suggestion to Flutter docs or Forge guides for transparency.

---

## üß© Final Strategic Note

Forge‚Äôs AI must never replace the developer‚Äîit must understand the developer‚Äôs design intent and express it safely in code. By enforcing schema validation, local privacy, and deterministic compilation, Forge AI becomes the first trustworthy intelligence in software creation.

---

# Forge AI Engine ‚Äî Architecture & Implementation Spec
> Forge AI Engine ‚Äî Architecture & Implementation Spec  
> Target: engineers implementing `forge_ai/` (local-first inference + optional cloud connector)  
> Scope: local model loader, task registry, validator, logging, plugin API, deployment

---

## 1. Goals & Constraints (short)

- Operate **on the ForgeGraph** (not raw Dart).  
- **Local-first** inference (WASM / llama.cpp); optional cloud fallback.  
- Deterministic outputs validated by JSON Schema + compile smoke test.  
- Human-in-the-loop: AI suggestions never apply without explicit user acceptance.  
- Full audit trail for every AI action (prompt, model, output, diff, user decision).

---

## 2. High-level Components

```text
forge_ai/
‚îú‚îÄ engine/        # core orchestrator (Rust or Go recommended)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ runner_local/  # WASM + llama.cpp wrappers
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ runner_cloud/  # gRPC client to cloud inference
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ validator/     # schema + build validation
‚îú‚îÄ plugins/       # task implementations (inspector, text2graph, refactor)
‚îú‚îÄ schemas/       # input/output JSON schemas (ForgeGraph fragments)
‚îú‚îÄ cli/           # CLI tooling (forge_ai CLI)
‚îú‚îÄ ui_adapters/   # glue to Forge Studio (JS/TS adapter)
‚îî‚îÄ logs/          # diff logs, model audit logs (local, encrypted opt-in)
```

- **Language suggestions:** engine = Rust (performance & WASM), plugins = Rust or Node (depending on ownership), CLI = Dart/Node, UI adapters = TypeScript (Studio side).  
- **Why Rust for engine:** safe concurrency, small native binary, strong WASM interop. If the team prefers Go/Node, keep runner_local compatible with llama.cpp bindings.

---

## 3. Core Interfaces

### 3.1 `ForgeAITask` (canonical interface)

```ts
interface ForgeAITask {
  id: string;                 // unique task id (e.g., text2graph.v1)
  name: string;
  inputSchema: string;        // path to JSON Schema
  outputSchema: string;       // path to JSON Schema
  run(context: TaskContext): Promise<TaskResult>;
}
```

### 3.2 `TaskContext`

- `graphContext` (partial ForgeGraph JSON)  
- `prompt` (optional string)  
- `userPrefs` (model preference, local/cloud)  
- `assets` (thumbnails, icons, optional)  
- `maxTokens` / `timeoutMs`

### 3.3 `TaskResult`

- `status`: `ok | error | warning`  
- `patch`: JSON-Patch (RFC6902) or ForgeGraph fragment  
- `explanation`: human-readable rationale  
- `confidence`: float 0..1  
- `modelMetadata`: `{ model_id, model_version, quantization }`

---

## 4. Local Model Loader (`runner_local`)

### 4.1 Requirements

- Support quantized models (ggml / llama.cpp).  
- Expose stable RPC/FFI interface to engine (sync + async).  
- Minimal memory footprint; ability to load/unload models on demand.  
- Provide WASM path for pure-browser local inference in Studio (future optional).

### 4.2 Design

- Process-based runner: engine spawns `llama_runner` process (or links via native binding).  
- API (gRPC or local IPC):
  - `LoadModel(path, options) -> model_handle`  
  - `RunModel(model_handle, prompt, params) -> stream<tokens>|result`  
  - `UnloadModel(model_handle)`

### 4.3 Example Flow

1. Engine checks `forge_ai/config.json` for `local_enabled`.  
2. If local, spawn runner, load quantized model.  
3. Send prompt, receive streamed response, parse JSON (strict pattern).  
4. Validate JSON, return `TaskResult`.

### 4.4 Security

- Runner executes in sandboxed user-space process.  
- No network calls allowed by default.  
- Model files stored under `.forge/models/` (encrypt-at-rest optional).

---

## 5. Cloud Connector (`runner_cloud`)

### 5.1 Responsibilities

- Securely connect to Forge cloud inference for heavy tasks.  
- Use gRPC with mutual TLS or signed ephemeral tokens.  
- Ensure ephemeral storage: uploaded graph fragments deleted post-inference.

### 5.2 Fallback Policy

- Local-first. If local fails or user opts in, call cloud.  
- UI must request explicit consent before any upload.

---

## 6. Validator & Safety Pipeline

### 6.1 Validation Flow (post-model output)

1. **Schema Validation:** validate `TaskResult.patch` against `outputSchema`.  
2. **Patch Application (Dry Run):** apply patch on in-memory ForgeGraph copy.  
3. **Forge Validate:** run `forge validate-schema` (fast) then `forge validate-compile` (executes `dart pub get`, `dart analyze`, `flutter build web` in sandbox container with strict timeouts).  
4. **Confidence Gate:**
   - If confidence ‚â• `auto_apply_threshold` (default 0.95) and compile succeeds ‚Üí suggest auto-apply with clear highlight.  
   - Else present suggestion in AI Pane for manual apply.

### 6.2 Security Checks

- Reject outputs introducing `custom_code` nodes unless user explicitly approves.  
- If patch injects network calls or unsafe APIs, escalate to manual review flow.

---

## 7. Plugin / Task Registry

### 7.1 Purpose

- Dynamically register AI capabilities (inspector, text2graph, layout_optimizer, refactorer, logic_composer).

### 7.2 Registration Example (YAML)

```yaml
- id: inspector.v1
  name: "AI Inspector"
  entry: "./plugins/inspector/inspector.wasm"
  inputSchema: "schemas/inspector_input.json"
  outputSchema: "schemas/inspector_output.json"
  runtimes: ["local", "cloud"]
```

### 7.3 Loading

- Engine reads registry at startup, validates plugin signatures (signed packages).  
- Plugins execute in separate process or WASM sandbox for isolation.

---

## 8. UI Integration (Studio Side)

### 8.1 Adapter Responsibilities

- Call `forge_ai` RPC to list tasks, run tasks, stream results.  
- Display suggestions in AI Pane with diffs + confidence, allow apply/reject.  
- Provide prompt modal for Text‚ÜíGraph and Logic Composer.

### 8.2 UX Constraints

- All AI actions are non-destructive: show preview and require apply.  
- Display model version and whether local/cloud inference used.  
- Allow user to revert any applied change (reuse history log).

---

## 9. Audit, Logging & Telemetry

### 9.1 Audit Data (Local)

Store audit entries in `.forge/ai_logs/`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "...",
  "task_id": "text2graph.v1",
  "prompt": "Create dashboard header",
  "model": "llama-3b-quant",
  "output_checksum": "abc123",
  "diff": "<rfc6902 patch>",
  "user_action": "applied|rejected",
  "validation": { "schema": "ok", "compile": "ok|failed" }
}
```

### 9.2 Telemetry (Opt-in)

- Upload anonymized metadata only (no source code) when user opts in.  
- Use telemetry to build training dataset (prompt hash, graph abstract features, user acceptance).  
- Provide UI for users to manage and delete their telemetry.

---

## 10. Schema & Patch Strategy

### 10.1 Output Format

- Prefer JSON-Patch (RFC6902) for diffs.  
- For large replacements, include `graph_fragment` + `apply_location` with explicit merge rules.

### 10.2 Merge Rules

- If patch touches node changed since suggestion creation ‚Üí mark conflict and require manual resolution.  
- Use node-level versioning: each node tracks `node_version` incremented on edits.

---

## 11. CI / Tests

### 11.1 Unit Tests

- Model runner mocks for synchronous behavior.  
- Validator tests with intentionally malformed outputs to ensure rejection path.  
- Plugin registry tests (loading/unloading, signing enforcement).

### 11.2 Integration Tests

- End-to-end: Prompt ‚Üí Model Stub ‚Üí Patch ‚Üí Schema Validate ‚Üí Compile (containerized).  
- Smoke tests with 100 small graphs to ensure performance.  
- Regression scenarios covering inspector/text2graph/refactorer flows.

### 11.3 Regression / Eval Suite

- Maintain `ai_eval/` with 500 prompt‚Üíexpected graph pairs.  
- Run nightly to ensure model updates do not regress.

---

## 12. Data & Model Management

### 12.1 Model Versions

- Store metadata (`model_id`, `quantization`, `vocab_hash`).  
- Keep `models/` immutable per release.

### 12.2 Model Updates

- Canary rollout: test new model on 1% of local users (opt-in), run eval suite.  
- Support rollback via config flip.

---

## 13. Deployment & Ops

### 13.1 Local Developer

- `forge_ai run --local` starts engine + `runner_local`.  
- Dev mode uses smaller models by default.

### 13.2 Cloud

- Containerized inference services with autoscaling.  
- gRPC endpoints with mTLS.  
- Audit logs retained 30 days, auto-purged.

### 13.3 Secrets & Keys

- Store cloud tokens in local config encrypted via OS keystore.  
- Studio prompts user consent and relies on ephemeral tokens.

---

## 14. Security & Privacy

- Default: AI features OFF.  
- If user opts in, default behavior is local-only.  
- Cloud utilized only for heavy tasks with explicit consent.  
- No raw source uploads without confirmation; encrypt in transit, delete after 30 minutes.  
- Provide on-prem instructions for enterprise customers with strict data residency.

---

## 15. Minimal Viable Implementation (Sprint Plan)

### Sprint 0 (2 weeks) ‚Äî Infra + Inspector

- Implement engine skeleton + plugin registry.  
- Ship `inspector.v1` rule-based plugin.  
- Local runner stub (mock).  
- Basic UI Pane integration.  
- **Acceptance:** AI Pane runs Inspector on 100 local sample graphs and produces actionable suggestions.

### Sprint 1 (4 weeks) ‚Äî Local Runner + Validator

- Integrate llama.cpp runner.  
- Implement schema validator + patch application pipeline.  
- Deliver local-only Text‚ÜíGraph stub (template-based).  
- **Acceptance:** Local runner processes prompts and returns schema-valid fragments; validator blocks malformed output.

### Sprint 2 (6 weeks) ‚Äî Text‚ÜíGraph MVP

- Fine-tune small 3B model.  
- Implement prompt modal + preview UI.  
- Implement audit logging.  
- **Acceptance:** 100 curated tests pass (‚â•95% schema valid); average acceptance rate ‚â•60% on internal reviewers.

### Sprint 3 (6‚Äì8 weeks) ‚Äî Logic Composer & Refactorer

- Add Logic Composer task.  
- Implement component extraction Refactorer.  
- Add conflict detection & merge UI.  
- **Acceptance:** Logic Composer generates node graphs for 50 test prompts; Refactorer reduces duplicate subtree count by 60% in sample projects with manual accept.

---

## 16. Acceptance Criteria (Overall)

- All AI outputs validate against `forge_graph_schema.json`.  
- `forge validate compile` pass rate for AI-applied patches ‚â• 98% in internal tests.  
- Local runner operates offline and stays under 4‚ÄØGB RAM for 3B quantized model (target).  
- Audit logs capture every AI suggestion with model metadata and user decision.

---

## 17. Open Implementation Decisions (to finalize)

- Engine language: Rust vs Go vs Node (recommend Rust for engine + WASM).  
- Model families: LLaMA-distilled 3B for local, 13B/70B for cloud.  
- Patch conflict resolution UX (node-level vs structural merge).  
- Data retention policy for telemetry.

---

## 18. Appendix: Example RPC (gRPC) Service Sketch

```proto
service ForgeAI {
  rpc ListTasks(Void) returns (TaskList);
  rpc RunTask(TaskRequest) returns (stream TaskProgress);
  rpc GetTaskResult(TaskResultRequest) returns (TaskResult);
}
```

# PHASE 4: GROWTH & SCALE
**Duration:** Months 22-30 (9 months)  
**Team Size:** 10-15 people  
**Budget:** $150K-300K/month (funded by growing MRR)  
**Goal:** Reach 10,000 paying customers, $150K+ MRR, establish market leadership

---

## Month 22-24: Product Stickiness (Quarters 1)

### Months 22-24 Overview

**Strategic Focus:**
Make Forge indispensable so users can't leave even if they wanted to.

**Key Initiatives:**
1. Real-time collaboration (team features)
2. Version control integration (Git workflow)
3. Component library (design systems)
4. Advanced state management (complex apps)
5. Testing & debugging tools (professional workflows)

### Real-Time Collaboration

**What You're Building:**
Multiplayer editing like Figma, but for app development.

**Features:**

**Live Cursors:**
- See teammates' cursors in real-time
- Show name and avatar
- Color-coded per person
- Cursor position synced across Design/Dev modes

**Live Editing:**
- Changes appear instantly for all users
- Conflict resolution (last write wins with indicator)
- Presence indicators ("Alice is editing Header component")
- Typing indicators on text fields

**Comments & Annotations:**
- Pin comments to widgets
- Thread discussions
- @mention teammates
- Resolve/close comments
- Comment notifications

**Version History:**
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Named saves ("Before redesign")
- Restore previous versions
- Compare versions (visual diff)
- Branch-like workflows

**Permissions:**
- Owner (full access)
- Editor (can edit)
- Viewer (read-only)
- Commenter (can comment but not edit)

**Why This Matters:**
Teams are stickier than individuals. If 5 people on a team use Forge, they're unlikely to leave (too much inertia). Collaboration features enable enterprise sales and increase LTV.

### Git Integration

**What You're Building:**
Seamless workflow between Forge and Git repositories.

**Features:**

**GitHub/GitLab Integration:**
- Connect Forge project to Git repo
- Two-way sync (Forge ‚Üî Git)
- Commit from Forge ("Updated dashboard UI")
- Pull changes from Git (if code edited elsewhere)
- Branch support (work on feature branches)

**Workflow:**
1. Developer clones repo
2. Opens in Forge
3. Makes visual changes
4. Commits from Forge
5. Creates PR from Forge
6. Code review happens on GitHub
7. Merge ‚Üí Forge updates automatically

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Detect conflicts (code changed in both places)
- Visual conflict resolver
- Side-by-side comparison
- Choose: keep Forge version, keep Git version, or merge manually

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Trigger CI pipelines on commit
- View CI status in Forge
- Deploy from Forge (if CI passes)

**Why This Matters:**
Professional teams use Git. If Forge doesn't integrate, they won't adopt. Seamless Git workflow means Forge fits into existing processes rather than replacing them.

### Component Library System

**What You're Building:**
Reusable component system like Figma's components, but for code.

**Features:**

**Component Creation:**
- Select widget tree ‚Üí "Create Component"
- Name and categorize
- Define component props (customizable values)
- Set default values
- Add documentation

**Component Instances:**
- Drag component from library
- All instances link to master
- Edit master ‚Üí all instances update
- Override specific properties per instance

**Component Variants:**
- Button: Default, Hover, Pressed, Disabled
- Card: Default, Loading, Error
- Switch between variants visually

**Design Tokens:**
- Define once, use everywhere
- Colors: primary, secondary, accent, etc.
- Typography: heading1, heading2, body, etc.
- Spacing: xs, sm, md, lg, xl
- Update token ‚Üí all uses update

**Team Library:**
- Shared component library across team
- Publish/subscribe model
- Version components
- Private vs public libraries

**Why This Matters:**
Component libraries enable design systems. Design systems enable consistency. Consistency enables scaling design teams. This is how enterprises work‚ÄîForge needs to support it.

### Advanced State Management

**What You're Adding:**
Support for complex state patterns beyond simple providers.

**Features:**

**Bloc Pattern Support:**
- Visual Bloc editor (events ‚Üí states)
- Event nodes (user actions)
- State nodes (app states)
- Transition logic
- Generate Bloc classes

**Redux/MobX Support:**
- Store visualization
- Actions/reducers editor
- State tree view
- Time-travel debugging

**State Machines:**
- Visual FSM editor
- States and transitions
- Guard conditions
- Actions on enter/exit

**Provider Improvements:**
- ProviderScope visualization
- Family/autodispose support
- Computed providers (derived state)
- Provider dependencies graph

**Why This Matters:**
Complex apps need complex state management. If Forge only supports simple patterns, it's limited to toy apps. Supporting Bloc/Redux enables enterprise-grade applications.

### Testing & Debugging Tools

**What You're Building:**
Professional-grade tools for testing and debugging.

**Features:**

**Widget Tests:**
- Visual test recorder ("Record interaction")
- Generate widget test code
- Run tests in Forge
- Show pass/fail results
- Coverage reports

**State Debugging:**
- State inspector (see all provider values)
- State history (timeline of changes)
- Time-travel debugging (rewind state)
- State snapshots (save/load state)

**Performance Profiling:**
- Widget rebuild tracking (which widgets rebuild unnecessarily)
- Frame rate monitoring (identify jank)
- Memory profiling
- Network request logging

**Error Handling:**
- Error boundary visualization
- Try-catch node in logic graphs
- Error state handling
- Crash reporting integration (Sentry)

**Why This Matters:**
Professional developers need professional tools. Testing and debugging capabilities signal that Forge is serious, not a toy. This enables production use.
